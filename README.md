# OOP (a small python tour)

This material accompanies a live coding session designed for BeCode students. Our goal is to provide a practical, hands-on introduction to the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The goal of this session was to provide a practical, high-level overview of the following four principles, demonstrating their application in Python. Remember that in real-world programming, these concepts are flexible and not bound by rigid, absolute definitions.

## The Four Pillars of OOP
Review your session notes and code examples for a deeper understanding of how these were practically applied:

| Principle     | Focus                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation | Bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (the class), and restricting direct access to some components. |
| Abstraction   | Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential information to the user. It's about providing a clear, simple interface.                         |
| Inheritance   | A mechanism where a new class (child/subclass) derives properties and behavior from an existing class (parent/superclass), promoting code reuse.                  |
| Polymorphism  | The ability of an object or method to take on many formsâ€”specifically, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.           |


This is a small live coding example with BeCode students. The goal of these examples is to help understand some basic principles of OOP. We went over the following principles very quickly making sure we dont put a definite definition of these principles in people minds because there are way to bend them. Each of these subject would need its own separate tech talk for a complete overview:

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
