# A Quick Tour of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python üêç

This material accompanies a live coding session/tech talk designed for BeCode students. The goal is to provide a practical, hands-on introduction to the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The goal of this session was to provide a practical, high-level overview of the following four principles, demonstrating their application in Python. Remember that in real-world programming, these concepts are flexible and not bound by rigid, absolute definitions. We should always focus on the the problem and way to fix them rather that applying rigid defintions.

## The Four Pillars of OOP

Review the code examples, reseach and ask as many question as you can for a deeper understanding of how these were practically applied:

| Principle     | Focus                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation | Bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (the class), and restricting direct access to some components. |
| Abstraction   | Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential information to the user. It's about providing a clear, simple interface.                         |
| Inheritance   | A mechanism where a new class (child/subclass) derives properties and behavior from an existing class (parent/superclass), promoting code reuse.                  |
| Polymorphism  | The ability of an object or method to take on many forms‚Äîspecifically, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.           |

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

If you have questions about the nuances of any of these principles, remember that each topic is vast enough for its own dedicated technical discussion!
